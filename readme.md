# C++ Two-Way Linked List Implementation

## About the Project

Welcome to the "C++ Two-Way Linked List Implementation" project! This project demonstrates the creation and usage of a doubly linked list data structure in C++. A doubly linked list is a versatile data structure that allows elements to be stored and traversed in both forward and backward directions.

## Implementation Details

In this project, I have implemented a doubly linked list from scratch using C++. The main features of this implementation include:

- **Node Structure**: Each element in the linked list is represented as a node containing the data and pointers to the previous and next nodes.

- **Insertion and Deletion**: The implementation supports efficient insertion and deletion of elements at various positions within the linked list.

- **Traversal**: The linked list can be traversed both forwards and backwards, thanks to the bidirectional pointers.
